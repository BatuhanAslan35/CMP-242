# CMP-242: Object-Oriented Programming 2 â€“ My Work So Far

This document summarizes my activities and learning in **CMP-242: Object Oriented Programming 2** during the first semester of the second year. It presents the exercises and in-class applications I have completed so far, as well as projects that will be implemented as part of the course.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered So Far
- **Inheritance** â€“ Learning how classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes.
- **Polymorphism** â€“ Understanding how objects can take different forms through shared interfaces.
- **Class Methods & Static Methods** â€“ Exploring methods that belong to the class rather than individual instances.
- **Dunder Methods** â€“ Using special methods to customize object behavior.
- **Exception Handling** â€“ Managing errors to make programs more robust.
- **And More** â€“ Additional OOP concepts introduced during lectures and exercises.
